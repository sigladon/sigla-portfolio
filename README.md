I completed the  challenge with HTML and CSS. This is the fourth challenge of DevChallenges I complete. This challenge seemed simpler to me, in addition to the fact that I think it is the one that has been best for me compared to the previous ones that I completed.  
### Built With

I used [HTML](https://github.com/sigladon/recipe-page/blob/master/index.html) and [CSS](https://github.com/sigladon/recipe-page/tree/master/css)
