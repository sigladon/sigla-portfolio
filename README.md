I completed the  challenge with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is the tenth challenge of DevChallenges I complete. This last challenge was interesting because it is the one that has the most customization. I used grid so that the page could be displayed well on various types of screens. I like the color scheme as it looks, but I'll most likely end up changing it over time. 
### Built With
